# Introduction

This repository is a simple test one.
No real code should be submitted here, as all can be removed without any notice.

It currently implements a simple noop pipeline, with Jenkinsfile.

Thanks

Used for tests with github with versions fixes and more with just a job configured. Nothing on server side...
But we need a credential user/passwd registered and attached to the organization folder.
